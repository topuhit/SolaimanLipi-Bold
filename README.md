Desktop pc's only (SolaimanLipi font) fakes bold (synthetic bold versions) properly if the display is 96DPI. But on heigher DPI displays like mobile devices there is no difference between Normal and Bold font. Hope this SolaimanLipi-Bold will resolve this issue.
Also fake Bold font seems blurry whereas this will look sharp and crispy on various DPI devices.
