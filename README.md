Desktop pc's only (SolaimanLipi font) Fakes Bold properly if the display is 92DPI. But on heigher DPI display like mobile devices there is no difference on Normal and Bold font. Hope this SolaimanLipi-Bold will resolve the issue.
Also fake Bold font doesn't seems smooth whereis This will look sharp and crispy on various DPI devices.
